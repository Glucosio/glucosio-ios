/**

 RLMArray is the container type in Realm used to define to-many relationships.

 Unlike an NSArray, RLMArrays hold a single type, specified by the `objectClassName` property.
 This is referred to in these docs as the “type” of the array.

 When declaring an RLMArray property, the type must be marked as conforming to a
 protocol by the same name as the objects it should contain (see the
 `RLM_ARRAY_TYPE` macro). RLMArray properties can also use Objective-C generics
 if available. For example:

     RLM_ARRAY_TYPE(ObjectType)
     ...
     @property RLMArray<ObjectType *><ObjectType> *arrayOfObjectTypes;

 RLMArrays can be queried with the same predicates as RLMObject and RLMResults.

 RLMArrays cannot be created directly. RLMArray properties on RLMObjects are
 lazily created when accessed, or can be obtained by querying a Realm.

 ### Key-Value Observing

 RLMArray supports array key-value observing on RLMArray properties on RLMObject
 subclasses, and the `invalidated` property on RLMArray instances themselves is
 key-value observing compliant when the RLMArray is attached to a persisted
 RLMObject (RLMArrays on standalone RLMObjects will never become invalidated).

 Because RLMArrays are attached to the object which they are a property of, they
 do not require using the mutable collection proxy objects from
 `-mutableArrayValueForKey:` or KVC-compatible mutation methods on the containing
 object. Instead, you can call the mutation methods on the RLMArray directly.

#pragma mark - Notifications

/**
 Register a block to be called each time the RLMArray changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called with the initial array, and then
 called again after each write transaction which changes any of the objects in
 the array, which objects are in the results, or the order of the objects in the
 array.

 The change parameter will be `nil` the first time the block is called with the
 initial array. For each call after that, it will contain information about
 which rows in the array were added, removed or modified. If a write transaction
 did not modify any objects in this array, the block is not called at all.
 See the RLMCollectionChange documentation for information on how the changes
 are reported and an example of updating a UITableView.

 If an error occurs the block will be called with `nil` for the results
 parameter and a non-`nil` error. Currently the only errors that can occur are
 when opening the RLMRealm on the background worker thread.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When
 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.

     Person *person = [[Person allObjectsInRealm:realm] firstObject];
     NSLog(@"person.dogs.count: %zu", person.dogs.count); // => 0
     self.token = [person.dogs addNotificationBlock(RLMArray<Dog *> *dogs,
                                                    RLMCollectionChange *changes,
                                                    NSError *error) {
         // Only fired once for the example
         NSLog(@"dogs.count: %zu", dogs.count) // => 1
     }];
     [realm transactionWithBlock:^{
         Dog *dog = [[Dog alloc] init];
         dog.name = @"Rex";
         [person.dogs addObject:dog];
     }];
     // end of run loop execution context

 You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to continue
 to be sent to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `-stop` on the token.

 @warning This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the
          containing realm is read-only.
 @warning This method can only be called on RLMArray object which has been add
          to or retrieved from a Realm.
