  - Go to one of the repositories, click "issues" and type any word in the top search/command bar.
  - You can also filter by appending e. g. "state:open" to the search string.
  - More info on [search syntax within github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues)
* This repository ([glucosio-api](https://github.com/Glucosio/glucosio-ios/issues)) is *only* for issues within the Glucosio API code. 
* __SECURITY__: Report any potential security bug to us at hello@glucosio.org instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker

  - [Android client](https://github.com/Glucosio/glucosio-android/issues)
  - [API](https://github.com/Glucosio/glucosio-api/issues)
  - [Branding](https://github.com/Glucosio/branding-assets/issues)
